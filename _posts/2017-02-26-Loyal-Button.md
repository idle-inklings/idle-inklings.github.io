I was neither walking nor running. My pace was quickened and steps happy. I was rushing to my home. It was my neighborhood. I knew it as well as it knew me. It was late and dark so I wasn’t expecting any stranger. I knew many faces that lived in this neighborhood. But this face on the pavement was new, strange, unknown. I don’t know why but it bothered me. He was staring at my breast, unabashedly. I ignored him and walked by. 

I wasn’t rushing anymore. Tentative, I turned back. He was staring straight at me. What he wanted to hide, and what I saw was him pulling his hand out of his jeans. In that moment I knew this neighborhood wasn’t loyal, it had betrayed me. I walked at first, shivering, consciously aware of my body. Trying to hide everything I could. Trying to cover everything which was already covered. It wasn’t the first time I was realizing how insignificant my clothes can be. That no matter how I hide my breast or my curves, eve my neck or for the heck of it, all my face. Men would always grab all they could in one chance, from their glance. The clothes were no use, not loyal, they betrayed me. 

I felt him shadowing me. I dared not to turn around but I knew he was there, gaining on me. Then the moon took cover, it became darker. And I knew, by one cloud, hundreds of meters above, not even aware of my presence, in its natural course, had sealed my fate. That night the nature betrayed me. I broke into a run, sobbing uncontrollably. Then it happened, two strong arms pulled my waist even before they could held it properly. I instinctively shouted, but choked on my own tears. That night my own voice wasn’t loyal to me. My throat betrayed me. He dragged me into an alley nearby, it was dark and smelled foul. A dog, maybe woken suddenly from his slumber, growling, rose. Hope glimmered in my eyes. He did not bark, he did not pounce, scratch, bite. He ran away. The most loyal animal, betrayed me.

I turned to the predator, I begged him, folded my hands, cried. He lurked at me, groped my breast, pressed hard his groin against my stomach and tried to kiss me. In that moment I knew, the class of men betrayed me. What stood there was a savage lust driven animal, because the man had long left. No mother could bring up such a monster. 

He pushed me down. In one swift motion, threw away his shirt. He tried to pull my jeans off. Could not. I held on to them with all the force I could muster. Something struck him, he changed his mind. Started unbuttoning his jeans. Then it happened. When I was feeling betrayed, I found the streak of loyalty, where I expected it the least. His jeans won’t come off, the button won’t come undone. It stood. It helped. He released my hands to which he had restrained using his one hand, to work on his button. I was afraid, wasn’t stupid. This was my chance, I took it, grabbed a broken brick, smashed it in on his head with all my strength. He fell, whimpering. I ran, he wasn’t following. I ran, still afraid, but hopeful. Blessing the loyal Button, I ran to my home.
