I have always been a person who loves parties, night-outs, huge stories of insane things to tell. My first semester here was full of these days. Spent a night cycling around IITK's campus, ran after a ghost in the mountains, snuck out of campus to see the stars. All sorts of stories that people write about.

But lately I'm starting to think, we spend the best times of our lives just loafing on the grass.
Let me explain. The hour spent in silence staring at the stars with a friend, the walk in the day just to watch the butterflies, a small trek down to the riverside, a night spent gossiping with your roommate, a day spent playing UNO and dumb charades. All these moments that we forget about, all these moments are the ones that make us feel loved and keep us happy. It's these days where nothing really happens, where you just hang out with your friend stalking others on Facebook and Instagram, it's moments from these days that keep us going. The high that the parties give us goes away at some point of time, but these moments? They just build up little by little filling up our lives with content. I don't think I've ever been happier than when I am just walking around the city with a friend.

A post has been recurring in my NewsFeed 'Have friends you can have breakfast with'. And how true is that! Because lunch and dinner are like fancy outings where you dress up and try to be sophisticated, but what is breakfast? Breakfast is something you have at home, with people who feel like home.

So many people wonder about "what is the point of it all?" We all think about it on days where we work very hard and still fail, where something we wanted desperately goes wrong.

What if there is no point? What if all we were here to do was just lay around with some good friends and talk about the idiotic, useless things in life. What if the point was to just chill and be happy?
