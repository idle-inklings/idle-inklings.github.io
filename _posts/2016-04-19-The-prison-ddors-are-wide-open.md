Bells that rung, it was a Beautiful Day.\\
The chiming sound in the fresh morning.\\
The perfect dew drops. The green Lawns lay.\\
I dint go out. But it was a Beautiful day.

The silver walls across the window.\\
Children playing with flowers and the rainbows\\
I was small, I also wanted to play.\\
I dint go out; But it was a Beautiful Day.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The walls beside me glowed bright.\\
Grew Gray as it moved inside.\\
I saw the door of my room open.\\
It was no room, a common one.

It was the room that had saved me from.\\
From the harsh light, the rowdy storm.\\
It left me unheard to the voices outside.\\
The voices that had pushed me inside.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It was a beautiful day outside. But was safer within.\\
It was not the childhood innocence but cowardice within.\\
Afraid to face the voices against.\\
I preferred to stay in the shelter within.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

It was never a rejection;\\
They had just stated their opinion.\\
But to face this articulated objection\\
I found it warmer, this self made prison
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Its warmth had lulled me to sleep,\\
That I don’t rise up again.\\
Though I knew it is a Beautiful Day outside,\\
I won’t go out in the rain.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

The prison doors remain wide open.\\
To stay inside, I had chosen
