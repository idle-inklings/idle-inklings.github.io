Dear one and all, 

Your friend Mamta Bhagia has been kind enough, or foolish enough to ask me to write an article addressing you and your lives at this point, just because she thinks I am a good writer.
 
 Like you, I studied engineering, but I bailed out just before I became an engineer, and went on to do something completely different, on an adventure that continues to this day, many years later, and I am very thankful I did. This cannot qualify me to give you any advice, so none of that! Just a few insights that you might find interesting

It seems to me that the most remarkable, coolest, awesome people are just those who have found their place in the world, and know where they belong and exactly why they belong there. Every single day has purpose for them, and they are fulfilled. We hardly ever get to hear enough about being fulfilled, but a whole lot about being successful. We hear a lot about how we should prepare for competition, but very little of what we should do with ourselves, within us, with the things we can easily control. 

Kat Williams, the famous stand up comic, once asked how come lions don't stretch and warm up and do all that when they get ready to hunt prey. They just do what it takes, and they don't succeed nine times out of ten. No big deal! Lions are still kings! Strategists will tell you deer can, if they're smarter, come up with ways to outwit the lions! They already have! They just have more babies! It's the apex predators that we have to help so they don't go extinct! The deer know exactly what they're up against. The top predators are clueless against our onslaught on their habitat! Your generation, here in India, is hardly endangered. In fact, you're so spoiled for choice, that some of you have a hard time choosing what to do, and wondering, thinking about what you want from life, and so on! The fact that you have so much choice, puts you in the top 5% of the world's population. But, just like apex predators, you could be clueless about what is ailing you! 

Just like we can choose different paths, we can choose different attitudes. Some of us are instantly drawn to something, and we just know, we can make up our minds, and happily go in that direction. Some of us think something is a good idea and can pursue it relentlessly till we get to goals we defined for ourselves. Some of us are happy on a daily basis, doing exactly what we do, loving every moment of it. Some of us are angry like Virat Kohli, pushing ourselves all the time. Any of this might 'work out'.

 Funny thing about life is, it doesn't really seem to matter what we choose and how we choose to go about it. There have been millions who have done this before us and millions after us will do it. None of this matters. It really doesn't matter to the bigger picture what you score, or how much better than your peers you were in that interview you cracked. The joke could be on you if you hate your job that comes after, while the ones you beat went on to much happier places! So, I'd say, put in your best, but don't take anything too seriously. You win if you're happy. 

If you fall for the hype, and the giant marketing machinery out there, it seems to be a race to see who survives best! There's even a show called "Survivor", where people put themselves through unnecessary troubles by going to risky places! Why do they go there in the first place, and what is the compulsion to do stupid things? But this is not the question coming through, for it is hyped quite differently. 

If you fall for the hype, you too will do stupid things. The first time I went sailing, our instructor asked if we all knew how to swim. One of my mates pointed to her friend and said she is a national level swimmer, which she was. Our instructor smiled, and said, "We only want you to float around if the boat capsizes, not swim fast to the shore!" Clearly, we were there for sailing, and everything else was just an eventuality. We don't have to treat our lives like it is a perpetual crisis situation. 

Stress levels are killing people these days, and your age group is particularly vulnerable. What I am surprised by is how willing people are to be stressed out! You can do a search for the causes of stress, and find no less than a hundred causes, fifty of which you will be able to identify with right away. For all the brilliance in you, all the magnificence, all the wonders of creation that the universe has expressed through each one of your amazing brains, bodies, souls and minds, is stress the final master you should slave for? I don't think so.

 Yet, it is almost impossible to be clear about who we are, and what we want to do with ourselves, particularly when we are young and vulnerable, and insanely - capable! It is because you can do more than one thing that you might be hard pressed to choose. A potter who inherited that skill from a parent may find it a whole lot easier to become a great potter. Over the ages, many skills were passed on from generation to generation, and those skills just got better and better, and we never really heard stories of ambition, choices, options, drive, success, contributing to society, making a difference and don't hold your breath... making the world a better place! 

Truth is, we are each quite insignificant. Nothing will really go wrong with the world if you chucked everything, took off on a hike, smiled at sunrises over mist covered mountains, sang with the birds, and hung out with elephants around watering holes in jungles, and never came back. Similarly, nothing will really go right with the world just because you stood first in class, broke all academic records, found a phenomenal job, made a ton of money, married the most wonderful person, bought a plane, and took your family around the world. You see, both are pretty happy situations. But the first one is available to you at any time, and the second asks you to make some sacrifices, without guarantees in outcome! 

Securing the resources to live and live well is very important. Money being a great negotiable, automatically has a role to play. But it is only a resource. If you do well at whatever it is you do, you will have enough money. People at the top of their game in any game have no issues with money, thanks to how interconnected the world is, and we can easily connect ability with where it is needed. Your generation will never have this worry. But because you have so much within your reach, your generation is also bombarded with a whole lot of nonsense, that makes you focus on the outside more and more, just in order to keep up with all the stimuli you think you need to respond to, and stay updated with. 

You will hear words like 'unplugging' and going 'off-grid', in order to unwind, take a breath, relax, heal, and what not, but this is only because we have become notorious at plugging in, getting wound up, losing our breath, tensing up, and becoming sick in the first place! 
My grandfather, a farmer, had a six pack all his life, ate heaps of food, had plenty of energy, wisdom, a sense of humour, and time for other people, until he died at the ripe old age of 87, with perfect eyesight and all his teeth intact. He had time for stories, both telling and listening, never once fell sick, and was excited about life on a daily basis, loved interacting with people, learning new things, and exchanging ideas, thoughts, and what not. He took us kids out to the fields, made us swing from trees, swim, run and play, and at the end of the day, we'd be dog tired, but happy as can be. 

One of his grandchildren, thank God not me, is a very successful 'techie'. He has a high paying job, works his own hours, is a published author, has developed a well to do app., and has a young, happy family. He monitors his stress levels, goes to the doctor regularly, worries about his weight, pays attention to many many things that catch his interest, and he too loves interacting with people. But he's feeling burned out. It just isn't working out for him, for he's not happy. He has enough money to just retire, but he can't do that either for he needs to keep plugged into something! I worry about him! 

The word 'crisis' has become so commonplace now, in many people's lives, that we no longer recognize it as an extraordinary situation. It's just something to handle or manage, depending on how strong or resilient we are, or how strong the support system is, or just how plain lucky we each are! But it takes its toll, and by all measures, India is not a very happy country today. We are doing better on all indices, but somehow not quite leading beautiful, fulfilling lives in large numbers.

 As you look at all the options in front of you, you will find yourselves asking, "Which is best for me?", naturally. Perhaps you should also ask, "In which of these can I find the best of me?". It is you at the core that will need to be satisfied in order to be happy. Your competition doesn't matter, the job description doesn't matter, the organized climb to the top doesn't matter, if you care about your core. You will spend the rest of your lives finding out who each of you is on the inside, but I'd say, please, find the space and the time to listen to your core, and answer it, on a daily basis. Me time! Absolutely nothing else is worth it. 

So, what's the fuss all about? It's all the hot air about becoming 'great'! Statistically, 95% of us won't become anything great. But it is entirely possible for 100% of us to be miserable, trying to be in that 5%! This, we can choose not to be! 

This article to you will be meaningless if I couldn't slip in a word or ten about love. Yes, love! It is the most important emotion in life and it truly makes the world go around. This isn't just the giddy romantic love I write about. It is what makes each one of us unquestioningly take care of parents and siblings, care for our romantic partners, work ten times as hard for less than ten percent better results, pushes us to laugh, cry, break down, and do both amazing and crazy things.

 If there is too much logic to it, there is probably not enough love. It's got to be mad, and it's got to be unmistakable, inexplicable to a large extent, but it has to feel really good - that's it. Make sure that when you think you're in love, whether it be with a person, place, job, hobby, habit, addiction (just kidding), it's worth putting all of you into. Only then would you have answered the true call of love. 

It's too simplistic to say, "Find what you love". You could love a thousand things and not want to do any of it. You may choose to do something you don't care about just to make the money so you can dedicate yourself to what you love on the side. It might work just fine if you have such a plan.

 Maybe reality says, "Safety first", but I say, "Sanity first". Find ways to remain sane, people. One of the best ways to do that is, even while you search for exactly what you want to do in life, get to know what risks you are willing to take, and for what potential returns. Accept that life is random, and once you fail a few times, you can be shameless enough to keep trying more new things. It will drive you crazy, but you will be sane, very sane! You will be less afraid, and you'll smile a whole lot more.

 Accept also that much is outside your control, and all you can do is take your shots. You can take strong shots, and that is all that preparation is for. Whether the shot hits the mark or not, depends on how long it is. Again, statistics! Outcome may not be proportionate to effort on some paths, and these are the paths that worry people to walk on. Know if you're choosing an uncertain path, that you will be writing the story for those who follow you. So make your ride as interesting as possible. 

You may take your time finding out what exactly you want to do, but just as important maybe finding out what you don't want to do! If you recognize this, you can congratulate yourself! 

A few things you can control, to a large extent are your health, your environment, and the people you spend time with. Across all societies, across all income groups, across all age groups, these are consistent. Eat healthy food, be conscious of what you consume, for you are what you eat. Your physical health isn't just about buzzwords, six packs or measuring performance. It is freedom, and that feeling of being well is really worth it. Try and live in a clean space, and not deal with pollution and pollutants. It absolutely makes a difference.

 The people you spend time with - crucial. Some can take your energy away, some can make you negative, and others can be inspirational, fun, and full of ideas and beans! The choice is yours, and many times, solitude can also do wonders. Make sure your family gets your time. It's precious time and doesn't come back as life gets on! 

A word on competition - you competed with three million of your peers just to be born! You're already a winner, by far! From that point, things only get easier.

 Stay healthy, stay happy, and be available emotionally and spiritually to all the wonderful and terrible things life has in store for you - you can handle both beautifully. If you observe your parents, you will see it's much harder to be a good human being than anything else you may want to accomplish. Respect that and want that for yourselves, just because it is the right thing to aim for. Find more and more to love, and don't let friendships fade away. And for heaven’s sake, don't get unnecessarily inspired by anything! 

Be cool, like you already are! Be blessed, be grateful, stay positive, and spread the love! 

Cheers!
 BSK
