The city that never sleeps , the city of dreams ,the city that is the heart of this country - always working hard, always moving forward. Yes, I'm talking about Aamchi Mumbai! How much I love this place! Although sometimes I get the feeling that it's not the dream world I believe it is. Mumbai is a place which gives its people a lot of freedom. You can say what you want, be wherever you want at whatever point of time. But this freedom leads to a lot of trouble. Walking back home at night as a 14 year old girl, you get smacked on the back by a motorcycle rider. Your friend gets groped in a crowded bus. You can absolutely never enter the general compartment in the trains- always take the ladies one. Unfortunately, you can also do whatever you want. Mumbai is a very tolerant place, accepting everybody as they come in. But there is a darker side effect of being tolerant. You start tolerating even the wrong things. Never since that day have I walked across that road at night. A memory of something I used to do daily since I was a little girl, scarred. You have friends who smoke, drink, have sex - long before they're even 18. Yes, Mumbai gives you the freedom to do so. But in a way it spoils your childhood too. I had friends who were addicted to drugs in 10th grade! 14 year olds smoking pot. The idea is horrifying- but of course, like everybody else, I accepted it. Live and let live. You make your own choices, and I made mine not to. Now here at IIT Mandi, I meet people who haven't even heard of pot. Cannabis. Marijuana. Why you no understand?! I'm waking up early, sleeping early, being active, enjoying sports like badminton and playing dumbcharades, attending DJ parties without any alcohol, attending class religiously and actually studying. I feel like I'm regaining the childhood I missed out on. The childhood that should have been. So thank you, IIT Mandi for that. Thank you for letting me live my life productively which Mumbai, with all its glamour, snatched from me.
