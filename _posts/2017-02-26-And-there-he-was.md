And there he was.
A few metres away
but miles apart.
Dying to see him once,
she poured her heart out,
looking at the sun.
She was abandoned,
to ponder over the time that passed by.
To decide for herself,
the future with the guy.
Loneliness was starting to take over,
Darkness was starting to creep in.
She could not think of anything else
but the beautiful time spent with him.
It could only be an infatuation, she thought.
For if it was love,
he would have been there after all.
Dilemma was all she could feel.
She wanted to be with him,
but also wanted it to be real.
Few weeks passed.
One day she woke up,
and thought what a delightful day it was.
She saw him
and found a marvellous friend.
And in that moment she knew
that this was a beginning and not the end.
She found extraordinary love
in the little things around,
the laughs, the hills,
the river and the sound.
