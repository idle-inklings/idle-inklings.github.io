And there he was.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
A few metres away
{: style="text-align: center;"}
but miles apart.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Dying to see him once,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
she poured her heart out,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
looking at the sun.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
She was abandoned,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
to ponder over the time that passed by.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
To decide for herself,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
the future with the guy.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Loneliness was starting to take over,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Darkness was starting to creep in.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
She could not think of anything else
{: style="text-align: center;"}
but the beautiful time spent with him.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
It could only be an infatuation, she thought.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
For if it was love,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
he would have been there after all.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Dilemma was all she could feel.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
She wanted to be with him,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
but also wanted it to be real.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
Few weeks passed.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
One day she woke up,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
and thought what a delightful day it was.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
She saw him
{: style="text-align: center;"}
and found a marvellous friend.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
And in that moment she knew
{: style="text-align: center;"}
that this was a beginning and not the end.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
She found extraordinary love
{: style="text-align: center;"}
in the little things around,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
the laughs, the hills,
{: style="text-align: center;"}
the river and the sound.
{: style="text-align: center;"}
{: style="text-align: center;"}
